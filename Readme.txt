What does this mod do?
It allows you as a player via edict to set a number of allowed subspecies (per empire) up to 20. It doesn't do anything more or less.

Does the limit apply to player?
No.

What's the point of this mod?
Well... The AI creates all sorts of subspecies whether it needs to or not. That can clutter the UI so I kinda thought you might want to limit that and make AI stop spamming so many subspecies.

Have you tested this?
Not very much. I used a "has_country_flag" instead of "is_ai = no" to switch between players in order to test this on the species screen. Cannot exactly test "is_ai = no" condition really any other way.

Is it compatible with xyz mod?
It is compatible with any mod (in theory) which doesn't modify "can_modify_species" game rule.

Is it Ironman or Achievement compatible?
Please, this is a scripting change. It obviously is not compatible.

Can you do xyz?
Maybe, if I want to really.

What languages are supported?
English. English is also not my primary language FYI (if you find spelling mistakes report them and I will fix them).
